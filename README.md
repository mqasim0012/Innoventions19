**Description**:
  Innoventions is one of the biggest annual inter-school science competitions in Lahore. This application aimed to:
    
    1.  Provide a uniform and dynamic platform for Innoventions to better advertise the event
    2.  Provide a simple, full-stack registration application. Meant to improve accessibility of registration by:
        - Allows user to keep track of and control registration progress using a custom, dynamic form (built using JS+CSS+HTML).
        - Registration database + Admin portal allows easy access for management (using PHP and MySQL).
    3.  Carefully designed UI/UX to improve registration rate by creating a better/immersive experience.


**To run on your own machine:**

  - To see frontend UI only: Simply open the index.html file with all other repositories present in the same folder.
  - To see the full application, launch app on an Apache server with PHP enabled.
  - Moreover, please make a MySQL database to accomodate database queries in registration process 
    - Innoventions.sql contains the database info.
    - db.php contains db credentials, which you might have to edit.
  - Let me know if you need anything clarified regarding the process!
